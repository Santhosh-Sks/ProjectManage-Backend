# 🚀 Project Management System

A full-stack **Project Management System** built using **React.js**, **Redux**, **Spring Boot**, and **MongoDB**. This application allows users to manage team-based software projects effectively, featuring task assignments, real-time collaboration, secure authentication, and chatbot support.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This system is designed to simplify team project collaboration by allowing authenticated users to:

- Create and manage multiple software projects.
- Assign tasks to team members and track their progress.
- Invite members via email to join specific projects.
- Use a Kanban-style task management system (To Do, In Progress, Done).
- Comment on tasks for communication.
- Use a chatbot for basic query handling or support within the app.

The frontend is developed using **React.js** and **Redux** for state management, while the backend uses **Spring Boot** with **MongoDB** for data persistence. JWT is used for secure user authentication. The system also includes email invitation functionality using the Java Mail API.
